// Graph undirected represented as ajacency list

// Basically an ajacency list undirected graph is a key value pair of linked lists
// Each key in the array is a vertex and each value is a linked list of ajacent verticies
// I'm also going to include a separate implementation which treats the value as obj
// Containing information on the vertex itself in addition to linked list
// This will be useful if we need to track coordinates, distances, etc.

// Basic Graph
class Graph {
    constructor(verts);
    this.verts = verts;
